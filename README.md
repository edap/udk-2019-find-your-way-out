"Shining 360" by [Claire Hentschker](http://www.clairesophie.com/)

 In the frame of the main topic of this semester ("navigation, orientation, information, intervention"), this course will focuses on the scanning of internal and external 3D spaces and on the construction of alternative paths to experience those spaces.


## Point clouds.
- Introduction to point clouds.
- Create and draw a point clound in openFrameworks.

## 3D scan of objects.
- How to use [metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) and how to import your scanned object in other programs.

### Resources/Inspiration:
- [Slit Scan Turntable by Convivial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Slit-Scan-Turntable/)


## 3D scan of external ambients.
- How to scan an external ambient using a photocamera.
- How to get a 3D model from a file video

## Space navigation
- Camera movements inside 3D scanned space.
- Possible interactions.

## 3D scanned model elaboration.
- Apply shaders to the model.
- From points to 3D surfaces using [MeshLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeshLab)
- Mesh deformation using vertex shaders.
