 In the frame of the main topic of this semester ("Orientation, Navigation, Information/Intervention"), this course will focuses on the scanning of internal and external 3D spaces and on the construction of alternative paths to experience those spaces.


## Point clouds.
- Introduction to point clouds.
- Create and draw a point clound in openFrameworks.

## 3D scan of objects.
* Introduction to photogrammetry
* How to use [metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) and how to import your scanned object in other programs. These tutorials refers to Agisoft photoscan, the new version of this software is called metashape, it works more or less the same. The following tutorials comes from [Golan Levin's course](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/)
	* Alex Porter's Tutorial: Capturing with Photoscan](https://vimeo.com/123701711)
	* *Optional viewing*: Alex Porter's Tutorial for [Alex Porter's Tutorial: Cleaning Photoscans](https://vimeo.com/123702711)
	* [Michelle's tutorial](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/michelle/tutorial2.md) for using PhotoScan
	* [Claire's tutorial](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/workshop/pdf/photogrammetry_from_video_with_photoscan.pdf) for PhotoScan from video frames.

## 3D scan of external ambients.
- How to scan an external ambient using a photocamera.
- How to get a 3D model from a file video

## Space navigation
- Camera movements inside 3D scanned space.
- Possible interactions.
- Multiple views, camera parenting, camera on a 3D path.

### Resources/Inspiration
- [Moving Cameras and Point of View by Golan Levin](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/moving-cameras.md)
- [Julius Von Bismarck, topshot helmet](http://juliusvonbismarck.com/bank/index.php?/projects/topshot-helmet/)

## 3D scanned model elaboration.
- Apply shaders to the model.
- From points to 3D surfaces using [MeshLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeshLab)
- Mesh deformation using vertex shaders.
- Video recording.
